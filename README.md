## Overview

Kimbho V1 is inspired by **GPT-like** transformer architectures but implements **Grouped-Query Attention** (GQA), splitting the query tensor into chunks while allowing each chunk to attend over the full range of keys and values. Combined with **Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)**, Kimbho V1 can handle sequential data more efficiently and generate high-quality text.

Kimbho V1 aims to push the boundaries of performance, with a goal of **GPT-4-level** understanding and generative capabilities. While real-world performance depends on dataset size, quality, and hardware constraints, the architectural choices lay the groundwork for advanced language tasks.

## Features

1. **Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)**  
   - Efficient attention mechanism that reduces memory overhead by splitting queries into smaller chunks.  
   - Preserves full-range attention for keys and values.

2. **Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)**  
   - Seamlessly integrates positional information via rotations in the Q/K space.  
   - Avoids the need for fixed or learned absolute position embeddings.

3. **Decoder-Only (Causal) Transformer**  
   - Autoregressive design suitable for text generation, summarization, chatbots, and more.

4. **RMSNorm**  
   - A simple yet effective normalization method that scales embeddings by their root mean square.

5. **Scalable Architecture**  
   - Easily adjustable hyperparameters (embedding size, number of heads, number of blocks, group size).

6. **Aspiring GPT-4 Capabilities**  
   - Built on modern transformer principles to achieve advanced NLP benchmarks and tasks.

## Architecture

Kimbho V1 follows a **decoder-only** approach:

1. **Embedding Layer**  
   - Converts token IDs into continuous embeddings.

2. **N Stacked Decoder Blocks**  
   - Each block contains:
     - **RMSNorm** + **GQA Multi-Head Attention** + **Residual Connection**  
     - **RMSNorm** + **MLP (Feed-Forward)** + **Residual Connection**

3. **Final Projection**  
   - A linear layer maps the hidden states to vocabulary logits.

4. **Causal Mask**  
   - Ensures each token only attends to itself and previous tokens, enabling autoregressive text generation.

## Usage

### Data Preparation

1. **Tokenize Your Corpus**  
   - Use a tokenizer (e.g., Byte-Pair Encoding, WordPiece) that maps text to integer token IDs.  
   - Ensure your `vocab_size` matches the size of the tokenizer.

2. **Create a Dataset**  
   - You need `(input_ids, target_ids)` pairs for each sample.  
   - For language modeling, `target_ids` is typically the `input_ids` shifted by 1 token.

3. **Build a DataLoader**  
   ```python
   from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

   dataset = YourCustomDataset(...)
   train_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True, drop_last=True)
   ```

### Training

1. **Configure Hyperparameters**  
   - `emb_dim`, `num_heads`, `num_blocks`, `group_size`, etc.
   - Set `batch_size`, `seq_len`, `num_epochs`, `learning_rate` according to your hardware constraints.

2. **Train the Model**  
   ```bash
   python train_kimbho_v1.py
   ```
   - By default, this script:
     - Creates the model (Kimbho V1).
     - Loads the dataset and optimizer.
     - Trains for a specified number of epochs using cross-entropy loss.
     - Saves checkpoints each epoch.

3. **Monitoring and Logging**  
   - The script prints average losses periodically.
   - Integrate with TensorBoard or other tools for more detailed logging.

### Inference

Once training is complete, load a checkpoint and generate text or answers:

```python
import torch

model = KimbhoV1Model(...).to("cuda")
model.load_state_dict(torch.load("checkpoint_epoch_3.pt"))
model.eval()

prompt_ids = torch.tensor([[12, 45, 67]], dtype=torch.long).cuda()
max_new_tokens = 20

for _ in range(max_new_tokens):
    logits = model(prompt_ids)  # (batch_size=1, seq_len, vocab_size)
    next_token_logits = logits[:, -1, :]
    next_token = torch.argmax(next_token_logits, dim=-1, keepdim=True)
    prompt_ids = torch.cat([prompt_ids, next_token], dim=1)

print("Generated tokens:", prompt_ids[0].tolist())
```

For more creative outputs, consider **temperature scaling**, **top-k**, or **top-p** sampling.

Below is a list of the **primary hyperparameters** as **actually defined** in the example model code (the defaults used in the training script). You can modify these to suit your dataset and hardware constraints:

| **Hyperparameter** | **Default Value** | **Description**                                                               |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `vocab_size`       | **1000**          | The total size of the token vocabulary.                                      |
| `emb_dim`          | **64**            | Embedding dimension (size of each token embedding).                           |
| `num_heads`        | **8**             | Number of attention heads.                                                    |
| `num_blocks`       | **2**             | Number of Transformer decoder blocks.                                         |
| `pad_idx`          | **0**             | Index used for the padding token (in the embedding layer).                    |
| `group_size`       | **4**             | Chunk size used for grouped-query attention.                                  |
| `rope_base`        | **10000.0**       | Base frequency for Rotary Positional Embeddings.                              |
| `seq_len`          | **32**            | Maximum sequence length for each training sample (dummy value in example).    |
| `batch_size`       | **16**            | Training batch size for the dummy dataset.                                    |
| `lr`               | **1e-4**          | Learning rate used by the AdamW optimizer in the training script.             |
| `num_epochs`       | **3**             | Number of epochs for the training loop in the example training script.        |

These values come from my **example code** that demonstrates how to train Kimbho V1 on a small dummy dataset. In practice, you would likely increase many of these (especially `emb_dim`, `num_blocks`, `seq_len`, etc.) to achieve higher capacity and performance.
